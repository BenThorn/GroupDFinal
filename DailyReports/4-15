Ben Thorn 

Worked on: Taking the locomotion controls and trying to apply them to the ‘drone’ which has the separate camera attached to it.
Will work on: Continuing to develop the drone, and taking it further to possible implement look interactions base off the drone’s camera.
Blocking issues: Had a lot of trouble with Unreal trying to get the drone to work- will consult my group

Worked on: Look based interactions from the HMD camera.
Will work on: Toggle buttons that work with the look based interactions, maybe also look based interactions from the drone camera.
Blocking Issues: None so far
