Feedback 4/22/19

- The thumbstick player movement (locomotion) is awkward
- Throwing the cubes, and stuff in general, is fun to do
- Haptic feedback when grabbing and dropping things is a bit extreme and can be tuned down a bit
- Middle sphere seems broken, but it was just a permanent toggle, which should be more clear to the user
- Although the level is fairly barebones, the objective should be clear to the player, and will be something to follow throughout development
- Arguments for making the red laser coming from the visor as is or to make it more subtle; I think we should be able to find a happy medium
- The controls are awkward and need tuning, locomotion is misdirected, no deadzone, and drone control wasn&#39;t working
- The concept as a whole was liked by users
