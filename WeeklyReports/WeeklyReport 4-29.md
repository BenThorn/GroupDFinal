* Player movement still awkward; update locomotion
	1. Use gamepad?
* Level coming along
* Drone screen and live updates are cool to see
* Planned updates sound appealing
* Needs to be fleshed out a lot more
* Environment looks nice
	1. Background terrain is solid
	2. Do more of this
	3. Add assets that add to the scene
* Need to apply sound
	1. We have some ideas
