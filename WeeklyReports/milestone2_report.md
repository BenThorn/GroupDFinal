Report of progress for Milestone 2

## About this Milestone 

At this point, you should have base research done on the technologies to use and have your workflow in place. Your focus this week should be on building and developing your program. Next Monday will be Milestone 3, where you will demonstrate your app to the professor. You will need to describe the parts that members contributed. The app will not have to be fully integrated for Milestone 3, but does need to be a working minimally viable product by Milestone 4 for class play test. 

## Questions to Answer for Milestone 2

### Do you have your technologies/SDKs researched? 

List technologies here as well as anything requires further research:

* Unreal 4.21.1
* Windows Mixed Reality (Steam VR?)

### What is the vision for the application you are committing to for the next milestone?

The vision for this project is to have a player solve puzzles while using different drones/robots that are positioned in the level. The player will be able to interact with panels in the level that allow them to control the drones and see from their view. The core gameplay of this project will be centered around using devices to find different keys in the level that will allow the player to progress.

For Milestone 3 we want to have a basic world set up that the player can move around in, with a panel on the wall to have a separate camera render to. This will be the foundation of having a controllable drone/robot in the scene.

### Do you have a workflow in place? 

We don't have a concrete workflow in place at this moment. At this point we have each taken on tasks that we are interested in and are working on and doing research for them.

### Do you have a common project started?

We are planning to have a project pushed to the github by Wednesday.

### Do you have major blocking issues at this time? 

Not at this moment.

### How will you be employing sound? 

We will be using sound to provide feedback to player when they use panels. The different drones will also emit sound (propeller noises from the flying drone).
