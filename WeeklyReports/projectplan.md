Final Project Plan

Group D- Ben Thorn, Kiernan Brown, Austin Duvin, Philip Petronis

  

Experience: VR

Toolstack: Unity or Unreal

SDK: Steam VR or Unreal VR SDK

Hardware: Windows MR Headset

  

General Idea: In order to keep the feel of the experience cohesive, we wanted to keep player movement to a minimum, as we felt that both typical stick-based movement and teleportation both didn’t really cut it for immersive movement. This may be circumvented if we explain that the player is in some sort of vehicle- we could even have tank controls to make more sense of it.

  

Ideas for Experience: 

- Some sort of puzzle or obstacle course where the user would be able to switch between on the ground and bird’s eye perspectives. 
- Similar idea, but more of an RTS game where you can control units from the bird’s eye view, but also switch a grounded view to be next to them. 
- A fishing game in VR, making use of motion controls for casting and reeling 
  

Primary Mechanic

- In a standard first person VR view, be able to look at an object in-game that will show a top-down or otherwise aerial view of the playing field, that will be used to manipulate objects and complete goals.
